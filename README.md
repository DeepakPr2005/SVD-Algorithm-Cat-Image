What is SVD?
SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is a mathematical technique used to decompose a matrix into three other matrices. It is widely used in various fields like machine learning, data science, and signal processing.

SVD decomposes any 𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix  𝐴 into the product of three matrices:

𝐴 = 𝑈 Σ 𝑉^𝑇

Applications of SVD
SVD is a powerful tool and is used in various scenarios:

Data Reduction: It reduces high-dimensional data to lower dimensions, commonly used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Image Compression: It compresses image data by retaining only significant singular values and discarding the rest.
Recommendation Systems: It decomposes user-item matrices to predict user preferences and make recommendations.
Noise Reduction: It removes noise from datasets by filtering out smaller singular values.
Pattern Recognition: Helps in identifying key patterns in data.
